Hello, World!

It's a tradition to start with "Hello, World" applications/scripts when experimenting or learning new platform/language. This is my new blog and here goes the traditional way. 

This site is a static website built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), an open source static website generator. Hmm, powered by [GitHub pages](http://pages.github.com/). 

**Here's why I choose Jekyll..**

- Extremely faster
- Ability to write content in markdown in your favorite text-editor (I love sublime text 2).
- Ability to write and preview your content via localhost.
- No internet connection required to build the static content.
- Ability to publish via git.
- Ability to host your blog on a static web-server. 
- Ability to host freely on GitHub Pages.
- No database required.

I will also be writing a detailed post on getting started with Jekyll and GitHub pages to build your website. 

Cheers,

Ashwin
