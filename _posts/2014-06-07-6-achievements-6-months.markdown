This dude at [levels.io](https://levels.io/) is building 12 startups in 12 months. The idea is interesting and here is why
[I’m Launching 12 Startups in 12 Months](https://levels.io/12-startups-12-months/) 

I am inspired by this idea and will try something similar. This does not mean I am building 12 startups. Instead, will do 6 different things (an application, or a book, or a website; anything) each month dedicated for one thing. 

Here’s the [whys](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_Whys):

1. I want to stop being lazy and motivate myself.
2. I have developed tolerance for caffeine, yet lazy! (No, not depression! Have consumed too much)
3. I want to stop spending time talking about people and focus on ideas. 
4. I want to finish what I am going to start.
5. [I want to stop fucking care about what others think.](http://ashwinkumar.me/posts/the-complete-guide-to-not-giving-a-fuck/)

In the last week of March 2014 I created an archive, [PhNest.in](http://phnest.in/) for [Producthunt.com](http://www.producthunt.com/) in less than 12 hours straight. Everything from thinking, designing, recollecting layouts that inspired me, coding; all in 12 hours and it was done. I was motivated. 

And then, after 9 weeks, I have done nothing like that ever. Have ended several weeks accomplishing nothing and started Monday’s without goals. I think I need to force myself. I want to force myself to complete things I start; for straight 6 months.

Today is 7th day of June. In the last week of every month I will be updating my accomplishments here. 

Between all these, I promise I’ll

- be kind to myself, family and friends 
- respect time 
- respect others time and sentiments 
- listen and respond to others 
- keep myself physically fit
- respect work and timelines

Want to be inspired for starting something? Go ahead and read some the following blogs:

<b>*Remember: Start something.*</b>

Special thanks to my friend [Neetha](https://plus.google.com/113488614031605128751/about) who mentors, mends and monitors me in all ways and make sure I do it right. 


Cheers,

Ashwin.
