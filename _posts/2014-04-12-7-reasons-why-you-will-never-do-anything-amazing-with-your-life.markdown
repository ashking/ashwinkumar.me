A unique perspective on what it takes to succeed in life.

I can relate every part of [this article](https://medium.com/life-learning/2a1841f1335d) with myself and most others on why we often not do amazing things in life. 

Original article by [Raymmar Tirado](https://medium.com/@raytirado) is shared in [Life Learning](https://medium.com/life-learning)

Summary form the post:

Basically, what I am trying to tell you is that, in this game called life, you don’t stand a chance…

1. Because You Have Not Failed Enough
2. Because You Care What Others Think About You
3. Because You Think You Are Smarter Than You Are
4. Because You Don’t Read
5. Because You Lack Curiosity
6. Because You Don’t Ask Enough Questions
7. Because You Can’t Handle The Truth


Cheers,

Ashwin
