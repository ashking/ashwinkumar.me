			Hello there. I am Ashwin. Yeah, I am a me. 
</p>
			<p>

			I am a software developer and yes no sunlight & no moonlight, it's only tube light. I love new work and enjoy learning all the time. I consider myself extremely fortunate to be able to work on things I love... 
</p>
<p>

			Around me I see a lot of things everyday. So I guess I would be making this place interesting where I can collect, share tips, tricks, some trends, and resources that probably could help you ignite a creative spark. 
</p>
<p>

			To know a little about me... Firstly, you will find me as a simple guy with simple straight forward thoughts. I would speak to you the first time as though we have known each other for years now... I am approachable, open and silent is the first feeling out of the box. Apart from this, I have always been a day dreamer... Wanted to be this that... Do a million interesting things... 
</p>
<p>

			Ummm... There's more to come...
